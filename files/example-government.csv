Essential Eight Maturity Assessment,adopt,techniques,no change,"<p><strong>Essential Eight Maturity Assessment</strong> is the foundation of Australian government cyber security posture. The <a href=""https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight"">ACSC's Essential Eight framework</a> provides prioritised mitigation strategies against cyber threats.</p><p>Regular assessment against <a href=""https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight-maturity-model"">maturity levels (0-3)</a> enables organisations to identify gaps and prioritise remediation efforts. Queensland Government mandates Maturity Level 2 for most agencies.</p><p>Integrate Essential Eight assessment into continuous compliance monitoring rather than point-in-time audits. Automated tooling can track configuration drift against baseline requirements.</p>"
Zero Trust Architecture,adopt,techniques,moved in,"<p><strong>Zero Trust Architecture</strong> operates on the principle of 'never trust, always verify'. This approach is increasingly mandated in government security frameworks, moving away from perimeter-based security models.</p><p>Key principles include micro-segmentation, least-privilege access, continuous verification, and assuming breach. The <a href=""https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism"">ISM's</a> access control requirements align well with Zero Trust principles.</p><p>Implement Zero Trust incrementally - start with identity-centric controls, then expand to network segmentation and workload protection. Document alignment with ISM controls throughout.</p>"
Privacy Impact Assessments,adopt,techniques,no change,"<p><strong>Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs)</strong> are mandatory for Queensland Government projects handling personal information under the <a href=""https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-2009-014"">Information Privacy Act 2009</a>. PIAs identify and mitigate privacy risks early in project lifecycles.</p><p>Integrate PIAs into project governance frameworks, conducting assessments during the design phase when changes are least costly. The <a href=""https://www.oic.qld.gov.au/guidelines/for-government/guidelines-privacy-principles/applying-the-privacy-principles/privacy-impact-assessment"">Office of the Information Commissioner provides templates and guidance</a>.</p><p>For high-risk processing, consider conducting Threshold Assessments first to determine if a full PIA is warranted.</p>"
Threat Modelling,adopt,techniques,new,"<p><strong>Threat Modelling</strong> systematically identifies potential security threats and vulnerabilities during system design. Frameworks like <a href=""https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling"">STRIDE</a> help teams think like attackers to build more secure systems.</p><p>The ISM requires risk assessment for systems processing classified information. Threat modelling provides structured input to these assessments and informs security control selection.</p><p>Conduct threat modelling workshops with developers, architects, and security specialists. Update models as systems evolve and new threats emerge.</p>"
Security by Design,adopt,techniques,no change,"<p><strong>Security by Design</strong> embeds security considerations throughout the development lifecycle rather than treating security as an afterthought. This approach aligns with the ISM's emphasis on secure system development.</p><p>Incorporate security requirements gathering, secure coding practices, security testing, and security review gates into delivery pipelines. The <a href=""https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/"">Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF)</a> mandates this approach for Commonwealth entities.</p><p>Train development teams on secure coding practices relevant to their technology stack. <a href=""https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/"">OWASP provides language-specific secure coding guidelines</a>.</p>"
Data Classification Framework,adopt,techniques,no change,"<p><strong>Data Classification Frameworks</strong> categorise information based on sensitivity and required protections. Queensland Government uses OFFICIAL, SENSITIVE, and PROTECTED classifications aligned with the <a href=""https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/information/sensitive-classified-information"">PSPF</a>.</p><p>Proper classification enables appropriate security controls, storage decisions, and sharing arrangements. Misclassification leads to either over-protection (inefficiency) or under-protection (risk exposure).</p><p>Implement technical controls that enforce classification-based policies. Train staff on classification responsibilities and provide clear guidance for common information types.</p>"
IRAP Assessment,adopt,techniques,no change,"<p><strong><a href=""https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/assessment-and-evaluation-programs/infosec-registered-assessors-program"">IRAP (Infosec Registered Assessors Program)</a> Assessment</strong> provides independent security assessment of ICT systems against the ISM. IRAP assessments are required for systems processing Australian Government classified information.</p><p>Engage IRAP assessors early in system development to identify compliance gaps before go-live. Assessment scope and rigour depend on the classification level of information processed.</p><p>Maintain assessment documentation and track remediation of identified issues. Re-assessment is required for significant system changes.</p>"
Continuous Authority to Operate,trial,techniques,new,"<p><strong>Continuous Authority to Operate (cATO)</strong> moves beyond point-in-time security assessments to ongoing compliance monitoring. This approach maintains security assurance while enabling agile delivery.</p><p>Implement automated compliance checking, continuous vulnerability scanning, and real-time security monitoring.
