Introduction,"The Technology Radar is a snapshot of tools, techniques, platforms, and languages & frameworks that we believe are relevant for organisations building software today. It reflects the collective experience and opinions of our technology advisory board, informed by real-world projects and continuous evaluation of the technology landscape."
Purpose,"This radar serves as a guide for technology leaders and practitioners making decisions about their technology stack. Rather than an exhaustive catalogue, it highlights technologies we think deserve attention—whether for adoption, exploration, or caution. Each item represents technologies that have crossed our radar through project work, research, or industry observation."
How We Build It,"Our technology advisory board meets regularly to discuss and debate technologies based on hands-on experience. We look for technologies that are gaining traction, showing promise, or requiring reconsideration. Items move between rings as our understanding evolves and as technologies mature or decline. The radar is opinionated by design—it represents our view of what matters."
Using This Radar,"The radar is organised into four quadrants representing different categories of technology. Within each quadrant, items are placed in one of four rings indicating our recommendation level. Use this as a starting point for discussion rather than a prescriptive mandate. Your context matters—a technology in Hold might still be appropriate for specific situations."
