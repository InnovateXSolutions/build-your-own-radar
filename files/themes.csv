AI Transforms Development,"Artificial intelligence is no longer just a tool we build—it's becoming a partner in how we build. From GitHub Copilot reaching mainstream adoption to emerging AI agents capable of autonomous task execution, we're witnessing a fundamental shift in developer workflows. Teams report significant productivity gains, but the need for human oversight, code review practices, and understanding of AI limitations remains critical."
Platform Engineering Matures,"The platform engineering movement has graduated from trend to established practice. Organisations are recognising that developer experience is a competitive advantage, investing in internal developer platforms that provide self-service capabilities while maintaining governance. Success requires treating platforms as products with dedicated teams and clear value propositions."
Edge Computing Expands,"The edge is no longer just for CDN caching. With platforms like Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, and Fly.io maturing, we're seeing complete applications deployed at the edge. This shift reduces latency, improves resilience, and enables new architectural patterns—though it also introduces complexity in data consistency and debugging."
Security Shifts Left and Right,"Zero trust security has moved from buzzword to baseline expectation. Simultaneously, software supply chain security has become critical, with tools like Trivy and practices like SBOM generation becoming standard. Security is everyone's responsibility, embedded throughout the development lifecycle rather than bolted on at the end."
